Game Description:<P>

<PRE>
	The player will be doning the role of Adrian. Adrian will be dropped off at a safe
point. He must then proceed to the main control center, bypassing or killing the creatures
which guard the place. His mission is complete once he destroyes the control center using
a remote-controlled explosive. However, this must be done before the ICBMs can be launched.

	There are different types of creatures with different abilities. The creatures have
a field of view. They are alerted once any intruder comes into their feild of view. The game
is over once the alarm is sounded and mission remains incomplete.

Story Line:<P>
</FONT></U>
<PRE>
	Loacated In the deserts of Nevada, Area 51 the eternally mysterious
facilities of the United States Army have been taken over by an evil scientist with
the help of his genetically engineered creatures.

	He plans to destroy the world using the the Intercontinental Balistic missiles
(ICBMs) which have been lying unarmed in the desert since the end of cold war. He plans
to arm these missiles and launch an attack on the world resulting in a Nuclear Holocaust.

	The Area is heavily guarded, and attacks by air have been ruled out due to the
State-of-the-art Anti Aircraft Battery.

	The only hope of the world is Adrian. He has successfully completed many commando
operations in Vietnam and Afghanistan.

	As the Hero is dropped off, he gets the information that the ICBMs are being armed.
The standard Arming and launch sequence takes some time. This is all the time Adrian has got
to stop the ICBMs from lifting off from their silos. Once Launched, ICBMs cannot be
recalled or destroyed.
