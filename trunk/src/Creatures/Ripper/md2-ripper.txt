Model description       : Started about 2 yrs ago (when the q2pmp was
 			  still in action) when i saw tremmors 2 on
 			  telly. Changed the design of the little guys
			  that busted out of the worms and went from
 			  there. It's been finished for some time but
			  i never completed the skins. It's here now.


Other info              : This guy's pretty short (about mid thigh on q2guy)
			  so if you consider this something of a cheat, avoid but
			  please, dont bitch me out for it. I've given the warning,
			  leave it at that. I'm not proud of the death or crouch anims,
			  they're pretty damned sloppy. The skinmapping in places is
			  also pretty messy but i did what i could with it.

Additional Credits to   : anybody?

* How to use this model *

Unzip ripper.zip to your quake2 directory, resoring paths. Select Ripper through your
player model menu in Quake2 and have fun.

Don't use this in anything without my permission. Don't use it as a base for a new model 
or convert it to other formats without my permission. If (for some absurd reason) you want to
use it in a commercial project, 1) make sure you ask 2) gimme a little money for it ;D
