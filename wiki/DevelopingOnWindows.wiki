#labels Phase-Implementation
*If you are looking to just try the game on Windows, please visit the [http://code.google.com/p/adrian/downloads/list Downloads] page.*


= Introduction =

Adrian uses Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express to build the software for Windows. You can download it [http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-2010-express here]. We would be testing this on 32 bit windows.

= Details =

== Install GLEW ==

Use the [http://glew.sourceforge.net/install.html instructions] from the GLEW home page and install 32 bit GLEW. 

Version tested for: 1.9

== Install SDL ==

= Compatibility =

If you are doing windows development, you can use this page to build for windows. Please NOTE that the main developers develop on Linux, so try not to break compatibility - by using specific windows functionality. If you have to - then use the "#ifdef	WIN32" for such code - but it is discouraged in favor of portable solutions.
